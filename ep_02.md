## Events in the Time Of COVID
- New formats being created
- How the difference in terms of event-feel makes it tricky to apply the same terms to events

## Stage fright
- Nobody likes to feel foolish, like they're letting folks down
- By worrying about this, you're letting yourself down

## Running hackathons remotely
- Sponsor promotions at virtual hackathons have shown to be more popular than in physical ones

## Events in a post-COVID world
- Virtual events cannot recreate the feeling of offline ones
- Once we stop pretending they can, we can get more value out of them
- Being able to reach for people is a huge benefit
- Prediction: Hyper-local events are going to be huge again like in the past
- Hyper-local events might risk a fragmentation in experience organising these
- Local events will need sponsoring, too
- This could be trickier with slower financing systems, a riskier coin toss
- It's easier to get a goodwill going with a smaller group
- Maybe this is part of a cycle, and conferences will be gone/less present for a while before coming back again
- What can we do/are we doing to get the cycle back (safely)

## Online speaking engagements
- Spending less time on talks, less spent on logistics, travel
- Sometimes, the shorter the talk, the more prep is needed
- Affecting folks differently
- Spending more time on engagement
- Being able to hop quickly between speaking and back to in-work meetings is easier remotely
- More opportunities for folks to do public speaking
- There may be a split in folks who can do online speaking but would for example prefer not to travel

## Dynamics of virtual events
- How has events being online affected speakers sticking around and engaging after their talk?
- Being at home leading up to the event feels different from being there in person
- Creating relationships at online events is impacted
- Events like [All Day Devops](https://www.alldaydevops.com/) have for several years been virtual
- Events like [re:invent](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/) would have a different purpose
- Experiences are much easier: Relationships are a lot harder
- Sponsorship outcomes are impacted

## Platforms
- Each have their tradeoffs
- Some have their purpose, others are more generic
- At offline events, fundamentals are the same: Attention will be on a person, slides will be involved, then attention will move onto someone else
- Virtual ones are heavily affected by the platform, dependent on the goal 
- Trying things out, like [April fools day in the Riot Games API](https://www.riotgames.com/en/DevRel/af-recap#author) can have big effects
