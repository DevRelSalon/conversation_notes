## Coding in Front of Others

## The art of the live demo

- Twilio 5 minute demo
- Using [CoScreen](https://www.coscreen.co/) for collaboration (and this note taking!)
- Downside to sharing code on video: Not being able to copy-paste, not accessible

## Sharing code on video

- [WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API) is not optimised for transmitting code
- Making sure the resolution isn't too high and the text is reasonably big, low framerate, colour contrast
- Not all syntax themes are accessible (colour contrast, accessibility)
- [Syntax highlighting](https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/syntax-highlighting-is-a-waste-of-an-information/)
- Highlighting different arguments, imports, exception highlighting
- Highlighting sections of code in presentation software as an obstacle ([Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/) is good for particular code samples)
- [ASCIInema](https://asciinema.org) create accessible terminal recordings
- [Paircast](https://paircast.io)
- Motivation: People want to bring their own tooling
- [Inventing on Principle by Brett Victor](https://vimeo.com/36579366)

## Integration of IDEs into streaming platforms

- Why don't we have a Twitch integration that provides a link to a git repo, container, "open in codespaces", "Glitch for Twitch", [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)
- A spiritual little sister or so of Codespaces (that's been making the rounds these days) is https://github1s.com/mozilla/glean (you append "1s" to an url and it opens the repo in a web-based VSCode instance)
- "Twitch plays with my VSCode"
- Two coding tags on Twitch: Software Development and Web Development

## Streaming platforms

- Animated lower thirds using CSS
- VTubers (Virtual YouTubers) using 3D avatars of the streamer, eye tracking for showing what's being looked at
- Algoraves: [Sam Aaron + Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/), [NERDDISCO](https://nerddis.co/), http://creativecodingamsterdam.com/, https://creativecodingutrecht.nl/, https://sonic-pi.net/
- [Inventing on Principle by Bret Victor](https://vimeo.com/36579366)
- [Nannou](https://nannou.cc/): Creative Coding in Rust
  - [Livestreamer who uses Nannou](https://www.twitch.tv/timclicks)
- You can embed metadata in a video container
- Several steps in a pipeline that should be able to be controlled, like captioning.
- Figuring out how to synchronise, say, captions with stream

## Artist performances

- [Rustfest Global had loads of fascinating ones](https://rustfest.global/schedule/)
- Great for refreshing minds in between presentations, also supporting the artists themselves
- [Flaki on Raise.Dev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMoSogmECIQ) showing his FireFox OS app
- Creative Coding: [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), [processing.org](https://processing.org/)
- Retro Coding, [PICO-8](https://pico8.io/), [Azure functions game](https://marcduiker.itch.io/azzure-functions-the-game) made by marc

- [Combining pixel art with your IDE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tonybaloney.vscode-pets)
- [Saskia Freeke on coding art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bepWMux1M44)

## Transcoding

- Twitch partnership required
  - Seems unfortunate for smaller streamers who want to reach audiences with less bandwidth
