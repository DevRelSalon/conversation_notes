## Virtual Events

- Aspects of accessibility, inclusivity, ticket pricing, lack of travel needs
- Attending events like [You got this](https://couch.yougotthis.io/)
- Trying to re-create the Hallway Track, of running into someone during an event
- Dealing with the lack of face-to-face interaction
- Adapting from being a week-long event to an ongoing series of mini-events
- How do we handle timezones? No matter when you hold an event, some region will be watching at nighttime
- Different locales will have different concerns
- Having local conversations is important
- These different audiences will have different needs
- Virtual unconferences are achievable
- Taking a [Miro](https://miro.com/) whiteboard and allowing folks to slot themselves for a stream
- Tools like Zoom are flexible for conference calls, and StreamYard are building one for streaming these conversations

### Sponsorship

- Interactions with virtual attendees
- Rethinking how the sponsorship model works for virtual events
- What are examples of good virtual booths? (Websites with call-to-action buttons, (live) video embeds [hopin](http://hopin.com/), dedicated booth times)
- Lower attendee numbers during virtual events

### Accessibility in virtual events

- Live captioning
- Sign language interpretation onscreen

### Pre-recorded talks vs. live ones

- A loss of interaction with the audience during pre-recording

### Defining an Event

- COVID has called our definition of events as gatherings of developers into question
- [Art of Gathering, Priya Parker](https://www.priyaparker.com/thebook)

### What's missing in the event space?

- Examples of unique events: [!!con](http://bangbangcon.com/), [Deconstruct conf](https://www.deconstructconf.com/), [Monktoberfest](https://monktoberfest.com/), [Strange Loop](https://www.thestrangeloop.com/), [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/), [May Contain Hackers](https://mch2021.org/), [EMF Camp](https://www.emfcamp.org/), [Barcamps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp), [Maintainerati](https://maintainerati.org/)
- How financing can help a conference shake its "scrappy" image, but keep the charm
- Corporate conferences overshadowing less-funded ones
- [Github Universe](https://githubuniverse.com/) taking place in San Francisco but being more of a global event with a focus on the Github product
- Who are the audience, and what are their needs?
- If the audience is narrow in scope, then one can adapt to their needs more effectively
- The unconference/open space model
- Grass-roots collaborations

### Clubhouse (platforms)

- Clubhouse has had moderation incidents that need to be accounted for. Hopefully fewer events move there. 
- As developer relations, it's our responsibility to use platforms that prioritise safety and inclusivity.
